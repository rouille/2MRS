# Use of the 2MASS Redshift Survey for UHECRs simulation
Benjamin Rouill√© d'Orfeuil

This suite of programs written in IDL has been used to generate some of the results presented in http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.1119v1.pdf. In our simulations, the UHECR source distribution in tridimensional space (direction and distance) is derived from the distribution of galaxies in the 2MASS Redshift Survey catalog (2MRS, Huchra et al. 2012).
